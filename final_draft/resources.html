<h1>Interested in Adopting?</h1>

<p>When approaching almost any shelter about adoption, you can expect to complete the steps below:</p>

<h2>Adoption Application</h2>

<p>Questions can vary, but typically include:

-Your contact information, 
-Other people living in the house, 
-Information on any other pets, 
-Home situation- whether you own or rent, 
-Any restrictions on animal ownership where you live, 
-Veterinarian contact information, 
-References.
</p>

<h3>Meet and Greet</h3>

<p>After your application has been approved, it’s time to visit your potential kitty to see if it’s the right fit. During this stage, some shelters will require a home visit to ensure
you have a safe environment for a pet. At Rescue Vets, we ask that all household members come to our shelter to meet the cat you’re considering.</p>

<h1>How Long Does it Take to Adopt a Cat?</h1>

<p>Necessary steps will need to be handled, such as contacting references and processing your application. Rescues that require a home visit will also need to schedule and complete 
that process before you can bring a pet home. All in all, time can range between a couple of hours to a few days. It’s important to remember, though, that these steps are put in 
place to help protect both animals and adopters.</p>
